      <p align="justify">
        WHEREAS, it is a tradition that bona fide Filipino residents traders in
        the Sulu Archipelago and Zamboanga del Sur by reason of geographical
        proximity, historical and social ties, are from time immemorial engaged
        in commercial intercourse with neighboring islands;
      </p>

      <p align="justify">
        WHEREAS, majority of the people living in those areas depend upon such
        trade as their principal means of livelihood and source of income;
      </p>

      <p align="justify">
        WHEREAS, in order to attain the foregoing objectives it is necessary to
        liberalize the procedure for entrance and clearance of cargoes and
        vessels of bona fide Filipino residents who are engaged in such trade;
      </p>

      <p align="justify">
        NOW, THEREFORE, I, FERDINAND E. MARCOS, President of the Philippines, by
        virtue of the powers vested in me by the Constitution as
        Commander-in-Chief of all the Armed Forces of the Philippines, and
        pursuant to Proclamation No. 1081, dated September 21, 1972 and General
        Order No. 1, dated September 22, 1972, as amended, do hereby order and

          1. That bona fide Filipino resident traders in Sulu Archipelago, the
          island of Balabac and Zamboanga del Sur who desire to engage in trade
          with neighboring islands shall properly register with the branches of
          the Philippine National Bank in Jolo or Zamboanga City or their
          designated representatives. Said traders may sell, buy, barter or
          trade any merchandise, goods or articles except those which are
          contraband or prohibited by the Tariff and Customs Code, as amended,
          or those which are banned by special laws and regulations, the value
          of which does not exceed Five Thousand Pesos (P5,000.00) per trip, not
          to exceed two trips per month, with such trading houses in neighboring
          islands as shall be duly approved and certified by the Philippine
          National Bank. The registry list containing the names of authorized
          traders and trading houses shall be transmitted to the Commander of
          the Southwest Command, who is hereby empowered to coordinate all
          activities and to undertake all necessary measures for the

          and effected at the ports of Jolo and Zamboanga City.
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          3. That only vessels duly registered with the Philippine Coast Guard
          shall be allowed to carry, convey or transport merchandise, goods or

          4. The Monetary Board is authorized to waive the requirements of
          Central Bank rules and regulations for purposes of carrying out this
          trade. The Philippine National Bank shall also undertake such measures
          as shall be necessary to promote the greater participation of the
          banking systems in the trade areas, including the designation of
          correspondent banks to pave the way for the gradual shift from barter
          trade.

          5. Merchandise, goods or articles imported pursuant to this Decree
          shall be free of import duties or taxes when sold and consumed either
          in Jolo or in an area in Zamboanga City which shall be determined
          under the implementing regulations. Merchandise, goods or articles
          removed or taken out from these two areas shall pay the necessary
          import taxes and duties and any individual in possession of untaxed
          merchandise, goods or articles outside of these two areas shall be
          held liable pursuant to the provisions of existing laws.
        </p>
